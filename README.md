# TimingApplication for Android Devices
This app is intended to take lap times for track athletes. With each recorded lap time, a finishing time is calculated based on the distance/event they are running. Multiple athletes can be recorded at once, making it easier for coaches to keep track of their athletes and understand their current performance.
